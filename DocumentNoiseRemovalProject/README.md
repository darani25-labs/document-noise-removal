# 🧾 Document Noise Removal and Text Enhancement using OpenCV

## 📖 Overview
This project removes **noise** from scanned or photographed documents and enhances the **clarity of text** using **Non-Local Means Denoising** and **light sharpening**.  
It is especially useful for restoring **old, noisy, or low-quality scanned documents** to make them clearer and more readable.
